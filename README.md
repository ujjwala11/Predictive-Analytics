This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, SMOTE is used to balance the classes before model training. Five different sampling techniques are applied, and five machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN—are trained and evaluated using accuracy. The results show that Random Forest performs best overall, while Stratified Sampling improves performance for models like SVM and KNN. The project highlights the importance of proper data balancing and sampling strategies in fraud detection tasks.

The results show that Random Forest achieves the highest and most consistent accuracy across sampling techniques, Logistic Regression also performs strongly with random sampling, while Stratified Sampling significantly improves the performance of SVM and KNN. Overall, the study demonstrates that both data balancing and the choice of sampling method play a crucial role in improving fraud detection performance.
